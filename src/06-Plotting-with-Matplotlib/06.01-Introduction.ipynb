    "Problem solvers collect data and make conclusions based on the results. One way to view results is with plots, chars and graphs. Plots can reveal trends in data and outliers. Plots are a way to visually communicate results with your team, supervisors, and customers. This chapter is all about plotting with a Python package called Matplotlib. Matplotlib is a popular plotting library for Python."
